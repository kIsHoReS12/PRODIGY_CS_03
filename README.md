The password strength checker evaluates the strength of a password based on predefined criteria such as length, presence of different character types i.e., uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters. It assesses the security level of a password by identifying potential weaknesses and providing feedback to the user on how to improve it. The feedback typically includes suggestions for creating stronger passwords, such as increasing length, using a mix of character types, and incorporating special characters. Password strength checkers help users create stronger passwords to enhance the security of their accounts and protect against unauthorized access.
